An N-body simulator written in C++ and SDL2. Hold left-click and drag to place a moving body with a velocity upon release. Right-click to place a stationary body.

Pressing 'P' will generate a random field of masses.
Pressing 'C' will clear the screen.
Pressing 'A' will generate a large static center mass with a field of masses orbiting it. This is meant to simulate an accretion disk.
